# Turbo Rally

Turbo Rally is a simplified text-based rally racing simulation.
It demonstrates vehicle selection, basic physics, weather effects
and lap time tracking. This implementation is intentionally minimal
and intended for demonstration purposes only.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12 or later (no external dependencies)

## Running the Game
```bash
python3 turbo_rally.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to select a vehicle, track and weather
condition, then choose the number of laps.

## Testing
Run the unit tests with:
```bash
python3 -m unittest
```
